# SafeFirebasePasswordReset

Firebase Auth's default password reset app is insecure, as it allows users to enter insecure passwords. This project provides a drop-in replacement.

SafeFirebasePasswordReset ensures that users enter a secure password:

...Whereas Firebase's default mechanism will accept any 6-character combination:

## Development prerequisites

* NodeJS >= 16
* Firebase CLI

## Adding into to your Firebase project

1. Find your Firebase project config by going to **Settings** (cog icon) --> **Project settings** in your Firebase console, then click **Add App**. Follow the steps to see a screen like this:  
![Firebase project config](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/6803964/229196168-258f4108-0a9a-4697-8b9e-4fe9a1f20755.png).  
Your project config is in the red box. Paste this into `src/firebaseConfig.ts` where indicated by comments.

2. Build the project:  
`npm run build`  
The build files will be created in the `build` directory.

3. Upload the `build` directory to any hosting service. If you want to use Firebase Hosting, just run `firebase init`, select Hosting, and answer the questions as follows:

4. In your Firebase console, select **Authentication**, then **Templates** (tab), then press the pencil edit icon, then click **Customise action URL**. Paste in the URL from your hosting service ***plus #***. So if your hosting URL is *httpsâ€‹://my-app.com/resetpassword/*, enter `https://my-app.com/resetpassword/#`. This directs password reset emails to your newly uploaded app.


The app is written using React and can be easily branded or customised.
